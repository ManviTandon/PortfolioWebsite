  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am currently studying Computer Science and Design with a big interest in both graphic design and art. My hobbies include traveling, painting, listening to music, and sleeping. I love roller coasters, the summer, going to the beach, and cookie dough icecream. I am taking this course to learn how to style and design websites. I hope to combine my interests in design with computer programming to create different layouts and styles.  </p>
